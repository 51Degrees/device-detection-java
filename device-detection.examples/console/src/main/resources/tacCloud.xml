                This means that you will first need a license key, which can be purchased
                from our pricing page: http://51degrees.com/pricing. 

                Once this is done, a resource key with the properties required by this example
                can be created at https://configure.51degrees.com/QKyYH5XT.

                You can paste the resource key here, or set an environment
                variable or System property called "SuperResourceKey"
                which will get inserted as the value.-->
