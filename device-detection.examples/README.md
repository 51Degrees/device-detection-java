## Introduction

This module contains two sub-modules - **console**, giving examples that are intended 
to be run from the command line/console and **web**, illustrating use
of 51Degrees Web/Servlet integration.

Among other things, the examples illustrate:
- use of the fluent builder to configure a pipeline
- use of a configuration options file to configure a pipeline
- use of the cloud device detection service
- use of the on-premise "hash" device detection service
- use of device detection pipeline for off-line processing tasks
- configuring device detection trade-offs between speed and conserving memory

In order to use the cloud examples you will need to obtain a free resource key. 
A resource key configured will all the properties needed
to run the examples can be obtained [here](https://configure.51degrees.com/jqz435Nc). 
To use the resource key in the example it can be supplied as a
command line parameter, pasted into the configuration file (where there is one)
or supplied as either a environment variable or a system
property called "ResourceKey".
