<p>This example demonstrates the use of the Pipeline API to perform
    device detection in a simple Web Application servlet project.
<p>In particular, it highlights
<ol><li>Automatic handling of the 'Accept-CH' header, which is used
    to request User-Agent Client Hints from the browser;</li>
    <li>Client-side evidence collection in order to identify Apple device
        models and properties such as screen size.</li></ol>
<p>The examples <code>GettingStartedWebOnPrem</code> and
    <code>GettingStartedWebCloud</code> differ only in their use of
    on-premise and cloud detection.
<p>This example demonstrates use of the PipelineFilter, configured via
    the <code>web.xml</code> and pipeline options <code>51Degrees-Cloud.xml</code>
    files, to create a pipeline using cloud device detection.
