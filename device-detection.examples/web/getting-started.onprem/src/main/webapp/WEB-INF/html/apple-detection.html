<h2>Client-side Evidence and Apple Models</h2>
<p>
    The information shown below is determined after a callback is made to the server with
    additional evidence that is gathered by JavaScript running on the client-side.
    The callback will also include any additional client hints headers that have been requested.
</p>
<p>
    When an Apple device is used, the properties from
    the first request above will show all Apple models because the server cannot tell the
    exact model of the device. In contrast, the properties from the callback below will show
    a smaller set of possible models.
    This can be tested to some extent using most emulators, such as those in the
    'developer tools' menu in Google Chrome. However, these are not the identical to real
    devices so this can cause some unusual properties. Using real devices will generally be more
    successful.
</p>
<p>
    By default, the additional client-side evidence is saved as cookies in the browser.
    When a future page is requested, these cookies will be included with the request and the
    device detection API will include them when working out the details of the device.
    Refreshing this page can be used to show this in action. Any values that are unique to the
    client-side values below will appear in the evidence values used (see below) and server-side properties
    after the refresh.
</p>
<p>The following values were detected using <strong>client-side</strong> detection.</p>
